<p>It’s been a year that I have been daily driving Linux as my main
machine. So far, the journey has been great. I have come to know a lot
of things and have been using many FOSS tools.</p>
<p>I have tried a few main distros like Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and
Arch. I liked Fedora and Arch because they are fast and good. Finally, I
have chosen Arch over Fedora because I like the package manager and the
rolling release.</p>
<p>I started with Gnome as my WM, later moved to KDE, but I feel like
both are bloated, and I need to use my mouse every time to do something.
I tried DWM, but I feel like it’s not for me. Then, one of my friends
suggested i3, which is so good and suited my needs. Currently, I use i3.
I am very fascinated by how this works.</p>
<p>Later, I found some tools which I use a lot.
<code>autocpu-freq</code> is one of the programs which increased my
battery life significantly.</p></main>
